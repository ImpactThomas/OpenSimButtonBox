Steps to verify the assembled PCB.

Please note, button detection is slower when "OutputSerial" is enabled. You need to hold the button for a 
bit longer to get detected. Disable the option once you are done setting everything up.


* Open latest firmware with Arduino IDE
* Set to Teensy 3.2 with "Serial + Keyboard + Mouse + Joystick"
* In Config.h, set OutputSerial to 1
* In AUXPins.h, set EnableAux1, EnableAux2, EnableAux3 to 0
* Upload Sketch to Teensy
* Open Serial Console from Arduino IDE

* Start with header pins 1-32, use the same button to test every pin. 
  You should see feedback in the Serial Monitor. The sequence is (US-layout) "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxABCDEFGH"
  NOTE: There is no "y" or "z" in the output

* Use one encoder to test pins 1A through 3B. 1 = left, 2 = center, 3 = right
  You should see output like this "EncLeft:right / check_rotary_encoders()"
  Rotate the plug if the "left" / "right" direction is reversed


* In AUXPins.h, set EnableAux1, EnableAux2, EnableAux3 to 1
  also set AUX1_Button_Auto_Hold to 0 for every AUX port
* Upload the new scetch
* Connect an LED or your multimeter to AUX1, AUX2, AUX3
* Connect a switch to pin 1, 2 and 3 on the 1-32 pin header
* connect the 5V connector
* Push and hold the button connected to pin 1 and turn the encoder on the right
* You should see the voltage on the port increase with every turn. The maximum will be around 5V, depends on your USB power source
* Now do the same with the rest and ensure all ports work


* Connect a latching switch to the "Pit" pins
  You should see "Pit limiter ON" when you activate it and "Pit limiter OFF" when you flip the switch again

* "Extra Pins" are not used at the moment


* The PCB should be functional at this point.
* DON'T FORGET to setOutputSerial to 0 in Config.h
  This will ensure that all of the Teensy CPU power is dedicated to handeling button processes
  and not waste any on sending serial messages.
