Arduino Nano Button Box
---

DO NOT USE THIS YET! This is mostly just code to test the concept!


This directory will contain the code for the arduino nano  to work as a simple stand alone button box
and a very simple Windows VB.NET programm to receive the button presses via the serial interface.
Since the Nano can not run as a HID the Windows programm will send the keystrokes to the computer.
