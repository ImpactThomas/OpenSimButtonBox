Modular Open Sim Racing Button Box
===============================

The Modular Open Sim Racing Button Box Project is an expandable button box designed for iRacing, build on a Teensy 3.2. The "main module" is designed to be very simple to build while still offering 15 buttons and 3 rotary encoders to navigate the iRacing Black Box screens. 
The design uses the internal resistors so wires connect directly from the switch to the Teensy board.


The main module requires (see "Sources List" for details)
* 3D printed case
* 5 (ON)/OFF/(ON) Toggle Switches (12mm neck)
* 3 Rotary Encoders with Push Button (6mm neck)
* 4 Momentary Push Switches (12mm neck)
* Arduino IDE (check Teensyduino Library for supported version)

* Teensyduino Library

The Open Modular Button Box Project - Main Module is complete and is currently being tested.



Expansion Modules
=================
Expansion modules will offer additional buttons, encoders and will connect to the main module. Each expansion module will serve a specific purpose like pit box, ERS control module, many push buttons and so on. 
Building these expansion modules will be a bit more advanced since it will require a button matrix or additional ICs.



INSTRUCTIONS & Sources List
===========================
I am still working on the documentation but most of it is complete. Please take a look in the "Documentation" directory. These are HTML files. Save them to your computer and open them from there.    
I will provide online documentation ASAP.
