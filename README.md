Modular Open Sim Racing Button Box
===============================

The Modular Open Sim Racing Button Box Project is an expandable button box designed for iRacing, build on a Teensy 3.2. The "Main Module" is designed to be very simple to build while still offering 15 buttons and 3 rotary encoders to navigate the iRacing Black Box screens. 
The design uses the internal resistors so wires connect directly from the switch to the Teensy board.

Expansion Modules
=================
Expansion modules will offer additional buttons, encoders and will connect to the main module. Each expansion module will serve a specific purpose like pit box, ERS control module, many push buttons and so on. 
Building these expansion modules will be a bit more advanced since it will require a button matrix or additional ICs.



INSTRUCTIONS & Sources List
===========================
I am still working on the documentation but most of it is complete. Please take a look in the "Documentation" directory. These are HTML files. Save them to your computer and open them from there.    
I will provide online documentation ASAP.
