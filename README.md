==================================

![example image of complete unit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KaiserSoft/OpenSimButtonBox/master/Documentation/Images/Prototype-v3.PNG)    

The Modular Open Button Box (MOBB) project is an expandable button box designed for iRacing, build on a Teensy 3.2. The "Main Module" is designed to be very simple to build while still offering 14 buttons and 3 rotary encoders to navigate the iRacing Black Box screens. 
The design uses the internal resistors so wires connect directly from the switches to the Teensy board.
