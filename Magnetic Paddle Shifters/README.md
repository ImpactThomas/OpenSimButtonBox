3D Printed Magnetic Paddle Shifter
---

These 3D printed magnetic paddle shifters are designed to be compatible with most button boxes used in the sim racing community.
There are two versions of the shifter. One is for a micro switch with "pin plunger", like the Omron D2F-01. The other version is for a micro switch with "hinge lever", like the Omron D2F-01L.   
The "pin plunger" version requires a more accurate printer since it is using tighter tollerances. The "hinge lever" part is more flexible with dimensional accuracy but the "hinge lever" switch may not be as reliable.
   
The shifters only require a few parts and are easy to print. Please have a look at the build instruction video for more detail on how to assemble one.

**Please note**, the current "RC1" designs have been modified after the above video was recorded. They contain minor design tweaks to make assembly simpler. The modifications are not tested at this time. ETA for testing is tonight (24.07.2017).
