3D Printed Magnetic Paddle Shifter
---

These 3D printed magnetic paddle shifters are designed to be compatible with most button boxes used in the sim racing community.
The shifter is designed to be compatible with the Omron D2F-01 micro switch. You may use the original Omron part or get cheap knock offs from ebay. 
   
The shifters only require a few parts and are easy to print. Please have a look at the build instruction video for more detail on how to assemble one.

Recommended printer/slicer settings
---
* The shifter body should be printed with at least 20% honeycomb infill
* The lever should be printed solid
* The paddles work great with 30% honeycomb infill
* The part is build with a 0.25mm layer height in mind
* Material used for my prints is PLA


File Overview
---
* The folder "Box Style" contains the current design. It is simpler to build and uses stronger parts when compared to the "Open Design".
* The folder "Paddles" contains different paddle designs. You only need one per shifter.
* The folder "Open Design" contains the older "open style" design. It is more complicated to build and requires exact distance between the lever and the switch. You probably don't want to use this.



Bill of Materials
---
The following parts are required to assemble one shifter unit. Each shifter requires on micro switch. The type 
depends on which Body you are printing.

* 2x 623ZZ ball bearing
* 1x M3x45mm flat head machine screw
* 1x M3 nut / locking nut for machine screw
* 2x 12x3mm neodymium magnet (round disk shape). 
You may order additional magnets to adjust the force required. I recommend at least one more 12x2mm
* 2x M3x12mm counter sunk screw for mounting the paddles to the shift lever
* 2x M3 nut for the M3x12mm counter sunk screw
* 2x M3 countersunk screw for mounting the unit to your button box or wheel
* 1x Omron D2F-01 or D2F-01-D3 micro switch or cheap clones D2FC-F-7N on ebay
